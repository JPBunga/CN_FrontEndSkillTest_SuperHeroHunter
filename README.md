This is the answer to CN FrontEnd skill test-2 (SuperHeroHunter)

Hi Everyone !
This is another small project with name "Super Hero Hunter"
This is a basic webpage for displaying multiple marvel super heroes on a single website.

So let's talk about my project a bit now.
The initial page looks like below:
<img width="940" alt="image" src="https://github.com/JPBunga/CN_FrontEndSkillTest_SuperHeroHunter/assets/143939539/63a55606-9030-4ff1-b3c0-23f181ddeaa8">

I've added my name in tri-color, to show some patriotism :)
In the navbar - we have a title, Home and Favorites buttons and then a search bar.

And then in the below section, we can see the cards layout showing numerous marvel super heroes with their name and some description below their respective image.
Below the description we have a link to navigate to the super hero's single page on clicking on any particular super hero's single Marvel page.
And the we have an Add to Favorite button on clicking on that button for a particular super hero card it'll add that super hero into the favorite list
>> you can navigate to favorite list from the Favorites button in the top navbar.

About Favorites button:
>> On clicking this Favorites button (present in the navbar), it'll navigate into Favorites page where we can see all the favorite heroes that the user has added earlier.
>> These favorites won't be deleted or removed even the browser refreshed or anything but until the user deletes/removes them from the favorites list.


Thank You !!
